I'm working towards making systems that can perceive, think, and do stuff – not just crunch numbers. I'm super interested in how **_hardware_, _software_, _AI_, and how we _design_ things all come together**. It's cool to see how circuits, code, and logic can turn into systems that sense, think, and react.
I like ideas that make you think differently about how machines understand and deal with the world. I'm always checking out physics, electronics, math, and new tech for intelligence. Each area helps me see how systems could act with a purpose, and mixing them all together is how I'm learning to get better at this.
I think intelligence isn't just something you add on, it's how you think about designing systems and how I learn. My aim is to understand and build systems that can learn, change, and act on purpose. It's a work in progress, always changing, and there's always more to learn.
